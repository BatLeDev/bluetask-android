[BlueTask](bluetask.batledev.com) is a powerful task management application designed to help you organize and keep track of your tasks efficiently. With a user-friendly interface, BlueTask ensures you never forget an important task.
This is the Android version of the BlueTask project. It is a simplified version of the web application, focusing on task management and user authentication.

## Features

- **Create, Modify, Archive, and Delete Tasks:** Manage your tasks effortlessly with intuitive controls.
- **User Authentication:** Secure your tasks with a login and registration system.
- **Task Labels:** Organize tasks with customizable labels.
- **Trash Bin:** Recover accidentally deleted tasks from the trash bin.

## Initial Project

BlueTask started as a project for a web development course. The initial requirements were to create a TODO application with various functionalities, such as task description, start and end dates, status, and priority management. Another course project was the development of a mobile TODO application. The initials subjects were different, but I decided to merge them to create a more complete project, with the same functionalities on both platforms, same authentication system, and same database.

The android application required just simples functionalities:

- **CRUD** Actions for tasks
- Each task has a **title**, **description**, **priority**, **context**, **start date** and **duration**
